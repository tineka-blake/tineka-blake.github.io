<h2 style="font-family:arial;">Let's Explore!</h2>
 
<p>
Take the journey together with your little one as they find a love of
movement through dance, yoga, songs, props and games!
</p>

<p>
Let your child explore their inner and outer world; flittering through
the distant lands of the Amazonian rainforest as a beautiful ballerina
butterfly or blossoming fruitfully from a small seedling to a sturdy
tree. Together you will take part in their transformation!
</p>

<p>
Your child is discovering <i>lots</i> about the world through play, so each
theme has been designed to allow their imagination and creativity run
wild! Each Wednesday will be an opportunity for you and your child to
grow together, have fun together and laugh together! Because what fun
would it be without you there too?
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of each class there will be a 15-minute welcome session
for you to arrive, have the possibility to chat with other parents in
the community, and of course to have a cup of tea! A drink and fruit are
always provided for you and your little one, which is included in the
price per session.
</p>

<p>
Classes are inspired by nature, and are complemented by the environment
at Nieuw Rotsoord, a wonderful location for toddler fun before and after
the class begins!
</p>

<p>
<b>Ages 2 &#x2013; 4, including parent or carer</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>First class/Intro = €9,00</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>10x classes = €90,00, valid for 12 weeks</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>2<sup>nd</sup> child = €6.75 / €67.50</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Limited spaces apply!</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Would you like to join us?</b>
</p>

<p>
Contact Tineka for your <i>introductory class</i>, by email
<a href="mailto:tineka.blake@gmail.com">tineka.blake@gmail.com</a>, or by
phone 0630058917.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf41b5cf">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>I have a baby to take care of, can I also bring them to the class?</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes, you are welcome! The class is aimed at 2-4 year olds, but if there
is a baby sibling in the family, you are welcome to attend the class
with your baby (free of charge).
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>My child is under the age of 2, can they still come along?</b>
</p>

<p>
Since development varies between each child, if you believe that your
child will benefit from the class, but is under the age of 2, you can
still come along for an introductory class. Just be sure to contact me
beforehand.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Can my child join in at their own pace?</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes, the life of a toddler can sometimes be overwhelming, if your child
has a moment where they simply don't want to join in or participate,
that's okay. They can join in when they're good and ready!
</p></li>

<li><p>
<b>Can my child experience a class before signing up?</b>
</p>

<p>
Yes! You can opt for an <i>introductory class</i> for your first session at
€9,00 before signing up for a 10-class strip-card. (The strip-card is
valid for 12 weeks, so you have a couple of lessons grace, if you need
to skip the class for any reason!). If you choose to sign up after an
introductory class, then you will pay for the remaining 9 lessons,
providing there are still spaces to do so.
