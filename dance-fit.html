      <h2>Dance Fit!</h2>

      <p>
        Immerse yourself in a range of cultures and traditions from all over the
        world, experiencing them first-handedly, through your arms, hips and
        feet!
      </p>

      <p>
        This dance will have you feeling funky for Freestyle; sassed up for
        Commercial; seriously Street and sexy for Salsa! Be prepared to lose
        yourself in the beats of the music, oh, and not to mention, a raise in
        your heartrate, a tone of the thigh, and a loosening of the hips!
      </p>

      <p>
        It's time to energise yourself, celebrate your body, and replenish your
        mind! It's time to express yourself whole-heartedly, for you to let
        yourself loose and to get into the groove! Sessions are without mirrors
        &#x2014; there's no need worry about how it looks on the outside. It's all
        about how it good it feels from the inside and how much fun you're
        having!!
      </p>

      <h2 > Questions?</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Will the steps be simple enough for me?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes. No experience is required. The level of this class is aimed at
        beginners, or for those that have lost their connection with dance and
        want to rekindle the flame!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What dance styles or genres will I learn?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be introduced to a wide range of styles including, but not
        exclusive to:
      </p>


      <p> - Afro-beats dance
        <br> - Street dance/Hip Hop
        <br> - Cuban Salsa
        <br> - Commercial dance (think Beyoncé!)
        <br> - Bhangra
        <br> - Modern Jazz</p>


        <p>
          You will be in the hands of a teacher whose experience spans from Tap
          dance to the Tarantella, and whose music playlists spans from Mozart to
          Michael Jackson. (Don't worry, I won't be teaching you how to
          moonwalk!). Just expect to witness diversity, and a whole lot of fun!!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Will I learn choreography?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          During the class, we will work with dance moves and short sequences that
          you can pick up easily in one class! Trust me. You will be taught in a
          fun, yet thorough manner, with steps and movements broken down into
          easily digestible pieces that we build up into short sequences!
          Additionally, we can revisit and build upon pieces to
          make a final <i>piece de resistance</i>!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>I'm ready to have fun! Can I try the class out first?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course! You can opt for an <i>introductory class</i> for your first
          session at €12,50, before signing up for a flexible 10-class strip-card. 
          The strip-card will be valid until the end of the year!
