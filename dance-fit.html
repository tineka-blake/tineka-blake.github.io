      <h2 > Questions?</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Will the steps be simple enough for me?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes. No experience is required. The level of this class is aimed at
        beginners, or for those that have lost their connection with dance and
        want to rekindle the flame!
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What dance themes will we visit?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        An example of the dance themes to visit are:
      </p>


      <p> - Dancing through the decades: 1970,  1980's, 1990's ...
        <br> - Cuban salsa 
        <br> - Commercial dance (think Beyoncé!) 
	<br> - Dancehall & Soca (Caribbean dancing) 
        <br> - Musicals (i.e. Hairspray, Chicago, Grease etc.) 
        <br> - Modern Jazz

      </p>


        <p>
          You will be in the hands of a teacher whose experience spans from Tap
          dance to the Tarantella, and whose music playlists spans from Mozart to
          Michael Jackson. (Don't worry, we won't be learning how to
          moonwalk!). Just expect to witness diversity, and a whole lot of fun!!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Will I learn choreography?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          During the class, we will work with dance moves and short sequences that
          you can pick up easily in one class. Really! You will be taught in a
          fun, yet thorough manner, with steps and movements broken down into
          easily digestible pieces that we build up into short sequences!
          Additionally, we can revisit and build upon pieces to
          make a final <i>piece de resistance</i>!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <b>What should I wear?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Anything you comfortable moving around in! Whether that's gymwear, t-shirt, leggings, sneakers... As you wish! 
       </p>
      
      
        <p>
          <b>I'm ready to have fun! Can I try the class out first?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course! You can opt for an <i>introductory class</i> for your first
          session at €12,50, before signing up for a flexible strip-card.
