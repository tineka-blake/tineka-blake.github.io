<p>
Hello. I'm Tineka, a <b>creator of dance and movement classes</b> for the English
speaking community here in Utrecht!
</p>

<p>
Up until now, I've been fortunate enough to be able bring my <i>love</i> of
dance to Sweden, Finland, Portugal, the UK, and the Netherlands, in the
form of courses, classes and workshops!
</p>

<p>
Having been classically trained and certified as a dance teacher in the
UK, Â­my home country, I have been exposed to a wide range of styles from
Ballet to the Bharatanatyam (of India), during my diverse studies and
persistent travels!
</p>

<p>
After relocating to Utrecht and settling into the international
community, I was inspired to start teaching well-crafted and unique
<b>dance classes for adults</b> that aids <i>fitness and health</i>,
but also quenches our thirst of <i> exploring different cultures
and traditions!</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Classes for children</b> that combine dance, yoga, songs and games
for heaps of fun! As a way to introduce children of the importance and
marvels of nature through play!
</p>

<p>
I also decided to offer <b>private lessons</b> and <b>small group sessions</b> for those keen to focus on a
specific aspect or area of dance or yoga.
</p>

<p>
All of my classes allow you and your child to learn confidently <b>in the
comfort of an <i>English</i> speaking environment.</b> As I believe there is a
world of difference between truly understanding the instruction of the
movement and simply copying it (the latter can be fun at
home!).
</p>

<p>
Lastly, I am also teaching <b>pre-natal yoga, dance and barre classes</b>
here in Utrecht, where I love to complement my classes the experience
with <b>guided meditation</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Yoga and meditation</b> are tools that have been fundamental for my
evolution on this journey so far! I look forward to finding more
opportunities to combine these transformative techniques into a truly
holistic experience!
</p>

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to read what I've written here. I look
forward to hearing from you and seeing you soon!
</p>

<p>
Tineka
