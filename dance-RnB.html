<h2>Dance RnB!</h2>


<p align="center">

<b>

Now possible to subscribe as a virtual online class, wherever you are!

</b> </p>

<p> To my RnB queens (and divas). These classes have been designed to get you moving to new and old-skool RnB hits. From Beyoncé (Michelle and Kelly), Rihanna, J.Lo, Ciara and we may even throw in a bit of Usher and Chris Brown. Why wouldn't we?! During the class I will lead you in real-time. You will see me and the rest of the participants in the class so we still create that lively class vibe and I am still able to give you the positive personal feedback you deserve!

These classes have been crafted to give you an extremely fun and joyful way to exercise that keeps our spirits flying high!! With easy to follow movements, and guidance from a qualified and experienced teacher, you will be definitely getting it down on your kitchen floor!

No previous experience of dance is necessary.

<b>Location: Online! Once enrolled you receive information on how to join the class. It takes only a Wifi connection and device (i.e. Computer, tablet or smartphone).
